# Voice Input Test Guide

## 🔧 Fixed: Auto-Stopping Issue

The microphone will now **only stop when you click it again**, not automatically after silence.

### ✅ What's Fixed:

1. **Continuous Listening**: The mic stays active until you manually stop it
2. **Auto-Restart**: If the browser tries to stop it, it automatically restarts
3. **Manual Control**: Only stops when you click the mic button again
4. **Reduced Errors**: Less intrusive error messages for normal speech gaps

### 🧪 How to Test:

1. **Start Recording**: Click the microphone icon
   - Icon should turn red and start pulsing
   - You should see "Voice Recording Started" notification

2. **Speak Continuously**: 
   - Say a few words
   - Pause for 3-5 seconds (this used to stop it)
   - Continue speaking
   - The mic should stay active throughout

3. **Manual Stop**: Click the microphone icon again
   - Icon should return to normal state
   - Recording should stop
   - Final text should appear in the input field

### 🎯 Expected Behavior:

- **Red pulsing mic** = actively listening
- **Gray mic** = not listening
- **Stays red** even during pauses in speech
- **Only turns gray** when you click to stop

### 🔍 If Issues Persist:

1. **Try Chrome/Edge**: Best Web Speech API support
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure microphone access is granted
3. **Refresh Page**: Clear any cached speech recognition state
4. **Speak Clearly**: In a quiet environment for best results

### 💡 Pro Tips:

- You can now have natural conversations with pauses
- No need to rush your speech to avoid auto-stopping
- Take your time to think between sentences
- The mic will patiently wait for you to continue speaking
