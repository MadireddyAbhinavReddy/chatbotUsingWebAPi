# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds voice-to-text functionality to the existing website, allowing users to interact with the application using speech input. The implementation will include a microphone icon in the user interface that enables users to record their voice and convert it to text, which can then be used as input for queries or other text-based interactions. A FastAPI backend will be created to handle the speech-to-text processing if needed for server-side processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a microphone icon in the interface, so that I can easily identify where to start voice input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display a microphone icon in an accessible location
2. WHEN the user hovers over the microphone icon THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating "Click to start voice input"
3. IF the user's browser does not support speech recognition THEN the system SHALL hide or disable the microphone icon
4. WHEN the microphone icon is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually consistent with the existing UI design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the microphone icon to start recording my voice, so that I can provide speech input instead of typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the microphone icon THEN the system SHALL start recording audio from the user's microphone
2. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL request microphone permission if not already granted
3. IF microphone permission is denied THEN the system SHALL display an error message explaining the need for microphone access
4. WHEN recording is active THEN the microphone icon SHALL change appearance to indicate recording state
5. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that recording is in progress

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stop recording by clicking the microphone icon again, so that I can control when my speech input ends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the microphone icon while recording THEN the system SHALL stop recording audio
2. WHEN recording stops THEN the microphone icon SHALL return to its default appearance
3. WHEN recording stops THEN the system SHALL begin processing the recorded audio for speech-to-text conversion
4. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my spoken words to be converted to text and displayed in the input field, so that I can see what was recognized from my speech.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speech-to-text processing completes THEN the system SHALL display the converted text in the appropriate input field
2. WHEN text is inserted THEN the system SHALL place the cursor at the end of the inserted text
3. IF speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the failure
4. WHEN text is successfully converted THEN the system SHALL allow the user to edit the text before submitting
5. IF no speech is detected during recording THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no speech was detected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice-to-text functionality to work reliably across different browsers, so that I can use this feature regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect browser compatibility for speech recognition
2. IF the browser supports Web Speech API THEN the system SHALL use client-side speech recognition
3. IF the browser does not support Web Speech API THEN the system SHALL fall back to server-side processing via FastAPI backend
4. WHEN using server-side processing THEN the system SHALL upload the audio file to the backend for conversion
5. WHEN server-side processing completes THEN the system SHALL return the converted text to the frontend

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a FastAPI backend endpoint for speech-to-text processing, so that browsers without native support can still use this feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives an audio file THEN it SHALL process the file using a speech-to-text service
2. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the backend SHALL return the converted text as JSON
3. IF processing fails THEN the backend SHALL return an appropriate error response with status code
4. WHEN handling audio files THEN the backend SHALL validate file format and size limits
5. WHEN processing audio THEN the backend SHALL handle multiple audio formats (wav, mp3, webm)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the voice recording process, so that I understand what's happening at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL display "Recording..." or similar status message
2. WHEN processing speech THEN the system SHALL display "Converting speech to text..." or similar message
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a clear, user-friendly error message
4. WHEN the process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback
5. WHEN the microphone is not available THEN the system SHALL explain why the feature is unavailable
